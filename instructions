Edit database.php. Set the name, login and password for the database. For example, if using MySQL with user "server" and the password "server" would look like:


public $default = array ( 
    'datasource' => 'Database / Mysql',
    'persistent' => false, 
    'host' => 'localhost', 
    'login' => 'server', 
    'password' => 'server', 
    'database' => 'marky', 
    'prefix' =>'' );

You need to modify the file .Htcacess Marky directory so that it is as follows:

# Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews 
# AllowOverride All # HERE PUT None, change to All 
# Order allow, deny # allow from all
You must then run the script marky_test.sql in the database.
